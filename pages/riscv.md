	- The RISC-V Instruction Set Manual comes in two volumes. Volume I: 
	  User-Level ISA contains general information about RISC-V, base 
	  instruction sets for 32, 64, and 128 integer architectures, standard 
	  extensions of the base instruction sets, and conventions. Generally 
	  speaking, the first volume covers all the necessary information to write
	   assembly user programs. User programs do not deal with so-called 
	  privileged functionality. Privileged functionality is required for 
	  programming operating systems or bare metal embedded systems. Thus, 
	  Volume II: Privileged Architecture covers information about these 
	  aspects and relevant extensions.
