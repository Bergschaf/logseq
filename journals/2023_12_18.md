  The Shoelace Formula can be used to calculate the area surrounded by the # symbols ( <ins>including the edges</ins> ). The grid is represented by a list of tuples,  containing tuples with the x and y coordinates of the points. The list has to be ordered clockwise (or counterclockwise).
  First, the area is computed using the #shoelace Formula. This area only includes "half" of the border, because the Coordinates are in the middle of the characters. The area of the the border can be accounted for by adding half of the number of elements in the border /

  #algorithm #AOC #shoelace #python
  Algorithm to determine the area of a simple polygon given the (Cartesian) Coordinates of its vertices
  $$A = \frac{1}{2} |(x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_3 + x_3 y_3 + ... + x_n y_1) - (y_1 x_2 + x_2 x_3 + x_3 y_4 + ... + y_n x_1)|$$
  
  ```python
  points: list of points (x, y)
  left = sum(points[i-1][0] * points[i][1] for i in range(len(points)))
  right = sum(points[i-1][1] * points[i][0] for i in range(len(points)))
  area = 0.5 * abs(left - right)
  ```
- # Picks Theorem
  #algorithm #AOC #picks_theorem #python
  Formula for the area of a simple polygon with integer vertex coordinates (and only the integer points inside of it count)
  A: Area of the polygon
  i: interior Points
  b: boundary points
  $$A = i + \frac{b}{2} - 1$$
