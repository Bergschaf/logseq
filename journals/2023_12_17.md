- #python #useful_function #defaultdict
  Defaultdict, normal dictionary, but missing items get created with a factory function
  
  ```python
  from collections import defaultdict
  
  s = [('yellow', 1), ('blue', 2), ('yellow', 3), ('blue', 4), ('red', 1)]
  
  d = defaultdict(list)
  
  for k, v in s:
      d[k].append(v)
  
  sorted(d.items())
  [('blue', [2, 4]), ('red', [1]), ('yellow', [1, 3])]

- # Heap Queue Algorithm
   #algorithm #heapq #python
  (The implementation in Python)
  A heap is a binary tree where every value is bigger (or equal) than its parent
  -> The root element is always the smallest

- # Heaps in Python
  #python #useful_function #heapq 
  An implementation of hhe Heap Queue Algorithm in python, the order is always maintained when calling `heappush` and `heappop`
  ```python
  from heapq import heappop, heappush
  
  lst = [1]
  heappush(lst,value)
  heappop(lst) -> smallest value
  ```
